# Typescript_Assignment_9.4

A simple Angular 2 starter project based on NPM, TypeScript, and Webpack. Used to show how to set up a project build workflow from scratch.

This master branch contains the simplest configuration. Other branches show some additional features:

  webpack2-aot: Ahead-of-Time template compilation, using Webpack 2 and the @ngtools/webpack plugin.

  bootstrap: includes the Bootstrap CSS framework.
  To work on this project:

Run npm install inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.

Run npm run serve to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at localhost:8080.

Run npm run build to bundle everything into the dist folder for deployment.

Run npm run build:prod to do the same as above but enabling optimisations for production.
